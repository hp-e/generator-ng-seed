[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for angular with typescript projects.

## Getting Started

### Get to know Yeoman.

He's a cool guy. He wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Run the generator

To install generator-ng-seed from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-ng-seed
```

Finally, initiate the generator and download packages in one go:
```
$ yo ng-seed
```

or to download packages later
```
$ yo ng-seed --skip-install
```

Tell it what to name your project, libraries to include and frontend framework to use. 

### Enjoy!

This generator comes with Webpack with tasks for compiling and running.

To build and run the project:
 
```
$ npm start
```

To build only:

```
$ npm run build
```
